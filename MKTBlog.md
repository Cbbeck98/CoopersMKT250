# W02 Reflection: Choosing a Business
This week I feel like I got a better feel for how this course is structured. As I went through the week I mostly looked at my canvas dashboard when I did my assignments. Normally this works for my classes but this class does not display them in order. If I would have done the assignments in order I feel that I would have gotten more out of it. From now on I will definitely be using modules. As far as creating and running a successful online business goes I am excited. I feel that this will be great to know for the rest of my life. On thing that I have found more frustrating is how much opinion is involved. As the course moves along I am interested to see how much of it is fact and how much is unstructured opinion. The reason I am so excited though is that I would like to run a small business in the future. Knowing the things that I will learn in this course will make my life decisions easier.

# W03 Reflection: Sourcing the Product
This week we got to learn a lot about affiliate and drop shipping companies. I had looked into drop shipping in the past but I never ended up doing anything with it. After this week I wish that I had. It seems that the most successful people are those that work the hardest and find where they can fit in the market. Knowing that I am willing to put in the hard work makes me believe that I can make a profitable online business. Now, just how profitable is another story. I also learned just how hard it can be to enter because of how saturated the market is. A lot of people think like me and also want the pros of an online business. It is for this reason that I am really glad that I had the opportunity to study affiliate and drop shipping this week. I definitely know that I will be applying the principles in my future.

# W04 Reflection: Site Builder & Hosting
This week as I was able to finish up project one and get my site hosting figured out I actually learned a lot. I did not expect to be able to understand all of it like I did because I tend to have a hard time making decisions. However, this week seemed simple even though there was a lot of work that I didn’t expect. For project one I ended up with pest control which I do feel comfortable enough with. It was not what I wanted to end up doing but the more I worked on the project the more it led me to that conclusion. Moving forward I don’t know if I will actually stick with my choices because the more I worked and thought the more things came to mind that could work better. Regardless, I feel that I will be more successful because of this week’s content and the processes that I was required to go through.

# W05 Reflection: Site Design
This week felt like a breeze compared to last week. In fact, last week was so much more work that I almost forgot that reviewed website design and buttons this week. As far as the button goes I feel like I got it down pretty good and know that I will be able to incorporate it where and when I need to. Now it’s just a matter of figuring out where and when its needed. Due to my businesses main objective of generating pest control leads I feel like it might be a bit odd to put a payment option. The one way that I can see it working is to have some sort of invoice page that a business can go to pay for the leads that I am sending their way. Regardless, I know that I will figure something out. It all depends on what I end up doing with my website design.

# W06 Reflection: Legal Structure
This week was pretty chill. However, the more that I learned about licensing the more that I got confused. In the end, I figured out what I needed to but now I understand why people consult lawyers for their law information. You do not want to make a mistake that will cost you a severe fine or even your entire business. When it came to taxes I feel that I had a good handle on things with being a finance major and all. Currently, I am a tax preparer for Baker Tilly so it was cool to see another side of things as I was looking through the resources. When it came to project two this week I felt really confident. I talked with brother Lundin on campus and got some help that will make it go smoother than I thought it would. I am just a bit concerned about how the selling of referrals to a certain area will go in this class. I guess we will just have to wait and see.

# W07 Reflection: Google Ads & Keywords
This week lined up a lot with the SEO course that I am taking on campus which really helped me to understand the keywords and keyword phrases. It's funny how simple and complex this week's material can be. What I mean by that is that you can go really deep into understanding every part of your target market and their trends, you can do a shallow overview and then test to see if you are reaching the amount of traffic that you need. I personally will be doing a bit of both to experiment and see how I can best optimize the traffic to my site. Another thing that I realized this week was that I won't be profitable until the semester is almost over because I can only sell referrals once I have consistent and reliable traffic to my site and contact my information. It is what it is though. Once I am done it will take very little maintenance to be successful.
