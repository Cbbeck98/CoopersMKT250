# W02 Reflection: Choosing a Business
This week I feel like I got a better feel for how this course is structured. As I went through the week I mostly looked at my canvas dashboard when I did my assignments. Normally this works for my classes but this class does not display them in order. If I would have done the assignments in order I feel that I would have gotten more out of it. From now on I will definitely be using modules. As far as creating and running a successful online business goes I am excited. I feel that this will be great to know for the rest of my life. On thing that I have found more frustrating is how much opinion is involved. As the course moves along I am interested to see how much of it is fact and how much is unstructured opinion. The reason I am so excited though is that I would like to run a small business in the future. Knowing the things that I will learn in this course will make my life decisions easier.
